    <string name="Texto5">When the dice he will give you 5 valores.Usando the basic strategy you will choose the values that are repeated more or worth amis points. It\'s just you remember that to mark should add the values obtained by particular game you choose with Full exceptions, Then Square and General, why these plays already have a set score.</string>
    <string name="Texto6">Time to score points you can not add all the points but choose a type of game and then you can add. For example if I have two deuces and 3 corners in the first move of the three possible. But assuming I want to corner as worth more points and is the one that is repeated so we add all totaling 15 points and corner table in our app you will score in corner. I make you a note dukes 2 and 3 machines TBM is a full play and is still mouth. So I can score 15 points in the table on Full move. But if the move is General of mouth. Ai the value becomes 100 points and the move is completed immediately because the player who made the general\'s mouth wins the match with the independent sovereign point if another player is winning.</string>

    <string name="txtComojogarLer">Let\'s learn how to play Bozo First of all you will need. a cup of Bozo and Five data. After Participants will have to decide who will start Á several ways to desidir that more will the explanation. The player who is starting will put the five data in the cup and shake until blended. And then throws on the table. Ai remove the glass carefully. not to untap the data. If given after the glass is untapped. Are one on top of another. This move error is not counted and the player can play again. Remembering! It\'s time to mix the data in the cup the mouth of it must be closed to not drop any data out of the cup. then made the first move. The player will still have two more chances to throw the dice. Just to confirm. After the first move he will choose what kind of play will want to do. If you want more details of the moves push the screen to the left or click the right arrow to more informções. The types of possible moves within the Bozo. Are these. The. Duke. Suit. Block. Quina. Seine. FUL. Then. Square. General. As in the illustration below. The mark you make. It will depend on the stones that come, fter the three shots. But you can mark what you want. For a good player follows a strategy. Since we\'re talking strategy, using the basic strategy. You will choose the values ​​that are repeated more or worth more points. Remember that to mark should add the values ​​obtained by the game you have chosen. More has some exceptions like the move. FUL. Then. Square. General. Why these moves have already set scores. Time to score points you can not add all the points but choose a type of game and then you can add. I will give an example here for you. If I have two duques.E three cornered. In this example I will talk about two kinds of possible moves. Well first let\'s assume that I want the corner. Why it is worth more and is also the most repeated. Then I\'ll add these TES machines, totaling fifteen points. Then I mark on the table in our application. Fifteen points in corner. But the other kind of play. As you can see. When you have two data which is Duke\'s value. And TES data from the edge value. It is also formed FUL move. That perhaps it was made the first shot. And when such a move is carried out in one fell swoop. It uses the term play of mouth. then the play gets 5 points more and FUL. Becomes worth 15 points. Then I can score table. in Joagada FUL. An important example. It is the general\'s mouth. When the player makes a move the mouth of General ie if coming five stones of qualqer value all the same. General forty points. Becomes one hundred points. Oh no way. The player who made that kind of move. Win instantly with sovereign point. And the game is finished regardless of whether another player was already winning. Basically this is how you play a Bozo.</string>
