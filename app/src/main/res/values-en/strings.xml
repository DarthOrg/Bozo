    <string name="Texto6">Time to score points you can not add all the points but choose a type of game,

         and on the table in our app you will score in quina. I make him a note, two duques and 3 quinas it is also a full play and is still mouth. So I can score 15
         points in the table, in full play. But if the move is the General bôca.Ai the value becomes 100 points and the move is completed
         immediately because the player who made the general's mouth, wins the match with the sovereign point, regardless of whether another player
         is winning.</string>

    <string name="txtComojogarLer">
        Let's learn how to play Bozo.
        First of all you will need. a cup of Bozo and Five data. After Participants will have to decide who will start.
        Á several ways to desidir it, the more we explanation. The player who is starting will put the five data in the cup and shake
        until blended. And then throws on the table. Ai remove the glass carefully. not to untap the data.
        If given after the glass is untapped. Are one on top of another. This move error is not counted, and the player
        You can play again. Remembering! It's time to mix the data in the cup, the mouth of it must be not to close
        drop any data out of the cup.
        then made the first move. The player will still have two more chances to throw the dice. Just to confirm.
        After the first move he will choose what kind of play will want to do.

        If you want more details of the moves push the screen to the left or click the right arrow to more informções.

        The types of possible moves within the Bozó. Áz. Duque. Terno. Quadra. Quina. Sena.
        Fúll. Seguida. Quadrada. General. As in the illustration below. The mark you make. will depend
        the stones that come, fter the three shots.
         But you can mark what you want. For a good player follows a strategy.
        Since we're talking strategy, using the basic strategy. You will choose the values that are repeated more or worth more points.
        Remember that to mark should add the values obtained by the game you have chosen. More has some exceptions like
        the move. Full. Seguida. Quadrada. General. Why these moves have already set scores.

        Time to score points you can not add all the points but choose a type of game
         and then you can add. I will give an example here for you. If I have two duques.E three quinas.
        In this example I will talk about two kinds of possible moves. Well first let's assume that I want the quina. Why it is worth more and is also
        the more repeats. Then I'll add these 3 quinas, totaling fifteen points. Then I mark on the table in our application. Fifteen points in quina.
        But the other kind of play. As you can see. When you have two dice which is Duke's value. And 3 dice from the quina value. It is formed
        full also move.

        That perhaps it was made the first shot. And when such a move is carried out in one fell swoop. It uses the term play of mouth.
        then the play gets 5 points more and ful. Becomes worth 15 points. Then I can score table. in Joagada full.

        An important example. It is the general's mouth. When the player makes a move the mouth of General ie if coming five stones of qualqer
         value all the same. General forty points. Becomes one hundred points. Oh no way. The player who made that kind of move.
         Win instantly with sovereign point. And the game is finished regardless of whether another player was already winning.

        Basically this is how you play a Bozo.
